    <p>Recently there was a <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2019/10/29/A-call-for-blogs-2020.html">call for blog posts</a> for the Rust 2020 roadmap, this post is my response to what I believe the Rust community should focus on for 2020.</p>
<p>To give some context of my experience with Rust, I started writing Rust when 1.0 launched in May 2015, and ever since I've tried to spend as much of my spare and professional programming time with it as possible. My first project was <code>rusty-cloc</code> a prototype of what would later become <a href="https://github.com/XAMPPRocky/tokei">Tokei</a>. Since working on Tokei I'm now fortunate enough to be part of and get to contribute to both the Rust Release team and the Governance Working Group, as well as having a full time position writing Rust code.</p>
<p>2020 will mark five years that I have been working with Rust and everyone in the Rust community, and I'd like to use this post talk about what I want to do to make not just 2020 but the next five years the best years for the Rust community.</p>
<h2 id="monocropping">Monocropping</h2>
<p>For the 2019 roadmap Jonathan Turner wrote a blog post called the <a href="http://www.jonathanturner.org/2018/12/the-fallow-year.html">The Fallow Year</a> (which I recommend you read) that posited that we should let the new designs <em>&quot;field&quot;</em>  rest (go fallow) while we focus on other areas. To extend the metaphor, I would say Rust has fallen into monocropping in 2019 by focusing too much on our technical debt, when we need to be addressing our social debt.</p>
<p>In the four years I've been in community I've met a lot people and quite a few who have since left Rust or programming altogether, while everyone has different reasons quite a few of these people have cited <strong>burnout</strong> as one of the contributing factors to them stepping away.</p>
<p>We need to focus on making a sustainable culture and organisation that can last for the next 5–10 years of Rust's life. The first step in which is being able financially independent from corporations like Microsoft, Amazon, and yes even Mozilla. While Rust is very fortunate to have such robust infrastructure on the technical side with Azure &amp; AWS, however our actual scaling issues are in our human infrastructure.</p>
<p>These companies haven't prioritised in investing in a sustainable ecosystem for Rust. When 1.0 launched there was ~30 members of The Rust Programming Language, now in 2019 we have ~200 members. This is nearly 7x the amount, yet we've changed very little to be able to adapt to this growth. No where is this more evident than out of the now 200 or so members, the amount that are paid for their time on Rust is still in the single digits, and this doesn't look to change any time soon.</p>
<p>This is not sustainable development, and not addressing it will only make the problem of burnout worse in our community. The burnout can already be clearly seen when you look at our <a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/2019-roadmap-progress/10862">2019 roadmap</a>, as others have noted there are a lot the goals are on not on track to finish in 2019. I don't think this was problem with the Rust developers, but rather it's a problem with a roadmap that misjudged the our actual capacity to accomplish those tasks, and over promised what we would have finished and ready.</p>
<h2 id="a-foundation">A Foundation</h2>
<p>For various reasons there's currently no Rust foundation or way to contribute to Rust's development (I recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sIgVnRAcn0">Aaron Turon's RustFest Rome talk</a> to know more about them). Right now we don't have a solution to these problems, nor do we have a clear path to move towards solving them. I would still like about some some concrete ways a non-profit entity would enable us to do more and create a better environment for everyone.</p>
<ul>
<li>Paying members for their work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Money isn't the solution to all problems, it does however solve a lot problems in a lot of people's lives, people shouldn't have to burn the candle at both ends between Rust and paid work to continue to be part of the community. The minutia of , at this stage we can all agree that we all should be paid more.</p>
<ul>
<li>Budgeting</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently The Rust Programming Language has no budget, we only have companies who've approved funding for specific people or projects. We should want have an executive decision about where our funding goes. We would be able to fund and run projects that excite us and that we want to support that aren't maybe profitable or attractive enough for corporation's to support.</p>
<ul>
<li>Event planning</li>
</ul>
<p>The Rust Programming Language currently runs two conferences (RustConf + All Hands) every year, both of these are planned by completely independent people with no communication between them. Instead as part of non-profit's budget we would be able to plan these events further ahead of time and save ourselves a lot of stress.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I gave it away by making it the title, but to answer the question as to what Rust's 2021 edition theme should be, I want it be <strong>Sustainability</strong>. Instead of focusing our resources in 2020 towards technical problems, I would want to put them towards creating an independent non-profit entity run by the Rust community built to support and sustain development on The Rust Programming Language.</p>
<p>Our community is built on our ability to solve hard problems, if we can build one of the fastest and most beloved programming languages, we can figure out how to support the people who helped make it that way.</p>
